1. You should be reading this file from your own file system, not a web browser.
2. Navigate to the src/ directory. In here, you will see some source code.
3. Create a new folder named exactly your GitHub username. Then copy, not move, the source code files into the new folder.

Youâ€™ve now made an atomic change in code. Before any commits, make sure you set your user.name and user.email to match up with your GitHub user name and email.

4. Add your created files.
5. Commit your changes. Make sure your commit message is meaningful and describes what changes you made.
6. From those files in your newly created directory, make changes to both of them. What you change does not matter, but try to make it fairly significant. For example, delete half of the repository or write a poem in comments. I don't expect you to run it.
7. Commit your changes.
8. Push up your changes to master. Remember you've forked the project, changesets go to your own instance of the repository, not mine.
9. Navigate to the res/ directory. It will be empty.
10. Create a new folder named exactly your GitHub username and navigate to it.
11. Draw a picture in MS Paint (or whatever) and throw it into your folder.
12. Add the file.
13. Commit the file.
14. Push up the changes.
15. Create a Pull Request back from your repository, to mine; sstutsman/assignment-one. Remember, this is done on GitHub.com, not through Git Bash. For the request, the base fork will be sstutsman/assignment-one. For the head fork, it will be YourUserName/assignment-one
16. GitHub will then prompt you for a title. Make sure you add your full, real name (not your GitHub username) for my sake.
